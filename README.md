In this project let's build a **Movies App** by applying the concepts we have learned till now. This project allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned till React Course and apply them in a concrete project.

You will demonstrate your skills by creating an app that will fetch data from an internal server using a class component, displaying that data, using **component lifecycle** methods, **routing** concepts, **authentication**, and **authorization**, and adding responsiveness to the website.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. You will also be given feedback by code reviewers after your project submission.

### Deployment

Use the command `ccbp publish RJSCP79ATS sample.ccbp.tech` to deploy your project.

> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_
>
> - All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.
> - Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being
>   imported into the tests.
> - **Do not remove the pre-filled code**
> - Want to quickly review some of the concepts you’ve been learning? Take a
>   look at the Cheat Sheets.
